# ML Training-Assistant Final Report
by Do Tien Dung, September, 2023

## Project overview and objective
The utilization of machine learning models, encompassing both segmentation and classification models, within caMicroscope, has been somewhat sporadic thus far. These models have not been seamlessly integrated with the core annotation functions of caMicroscope, namely manual annotation and preset labeling. To address this, the Machine Learning Training Assistant seeks to harmonize these models with the primary annotation functions. This integration aims to enhance user experience, diminish time requirements, enhance precision, and facilitate effortless editing during the annotation process within caMicroscope.

The project entails the implementation of two key functionalities within caMicroscope: ```Annotation Edit``` and ```Annotation Assistant.``` The ```Annotation Assistant``` function is designed to automatically refine user annotations, enabling swifter and more accurate annotation. Subsequent to annotating with the aid of the "Annotation Assistant," users have the flexibility to fine-tune these annotations according to their preferences through the "Annotation Edit" feature.
